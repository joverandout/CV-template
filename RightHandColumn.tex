            \item Worked in a SCRUM as a back-end developer in a team of 6 to develop a super important banking thing for a bank. This involved the use of scratch.
            \item Put some technical detail here, so it is clear that you did something impressive.
            \item Awarded second place of 40 groups, with the Bank very impressed with our \textit{“insanely good”} product, which included some super clever banking terms,
            as well as our big neural network or something into which we filtered comments. They also commended us for our presentation skills due to our use of animations
            in the PowerPoint. We were awarded a prize for our submission \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ}{\underline{our submission}}.

            \item In order to show my proactive nature I have included some evidence of my proactive nature. In this instance that means the inclusion of a personal project
            I did on my own without any direct instructions.
            \item Developed a Python script to solve a problem I discovered. The script would do some very clever technical stuff and that means that I could do something
            else as a result. This in turn led to blah blah blah.
            \item This program was used by my lots of people with everyone saying it's absolutely brilliant and deserves, and it is a billion-pound idea. It made everyday
            life much easier for everyone in the whole world and as such made life so much easier. This has shown I have a proactive nature or something. This is just
            filler to be honest.

            \item My dad owns a huge investment firm, and although he had a very high profile in the last banking crisis, he was allowed to stay on as its chair without any
            punishment. I did some messing about in the office for him last summer, so I can say I have been an investment banker basically.
            \item My dad said I was the best of all the interns and I hope one day to make the difficult climb from son of CEO to CEO. 
            \item My stint here allowed my dad to underwrite the whole thing as charity work and skimp on his taxes.
